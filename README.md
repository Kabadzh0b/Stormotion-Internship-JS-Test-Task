# Stormotion-Internship-JS-Test-Task 
I made all requirements from a technical task with some <b>new features.</b> This README is <b>about them.</b></br>
Restart - will restart your game.</br>
Info - will give you rules of a game in a modal.</br>
Change mode - will give you a warning if it is already started. You can confirm changing a mode with restart and can deny this action.</br>

Also, I wrote a good AI, but he can't win all games, because I am not very good in combinatorics, so I was concentrating on user-friendly functionality.
